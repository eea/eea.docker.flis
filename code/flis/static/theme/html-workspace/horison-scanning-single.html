          <div class="dictionary-item__description">
            <p>In the last few years there has been a marked decline of pollinators (not only) in Europe, which caused a relatively large concern among scientists and the wider public [6], [7]. Usable major insect pollinators are mainly species of the order Hymenoptera, which include bees (genus Apis), and also, for example, bumblebees (genus Bombus) [4]. Man most frequently used type of pollinator is the honey bee (Apis mellifera), which is a kind exploited for centuries in beekeeping for honey production and also plays a vital role in agriculture as a pollinator [5]. In the years 1985-2005, Europe has seen a decline in colonies of honeybees on average by 16%, although in different parts of Europe, the trends differed [8]. A scientific study published in February 2014 showed that some states have already insufficient honeybees population for pollination of all relevant agricultural production [9].</p>
            <p>Besides the current loss of colonies of honeybees is also the loss of other important pollinators. Currently there are almost one quarter of European species of bumblebees considered as threatened [13]. Of the five main species of pollinators in Europe are of three species of bumblebees, so it is an important group of pollinators, that re not used by humans directly, but which, together with the honey bee pollination contributes significantly to agricultural production [13]. Other pollinators include butterflies, moths and flies, about their role in pollination of agricultural crops and conditions, there are no accurate data [3].</p>

          <div class="dictionary-item__description">
            <p>For possible causes in reduction of pollinators in Europe we have identified drivers which fall within the natural and socio-economic processes. Losses on pollinators are probably caused by a combination of pressures, mainly including habitat loss, climate change impacts, diseases, invasive species, practices beekeepers and pesticide use [2].<br />
            Degradation and fragmentation of habitats due to variation in land use is considered one of the main reasons for reducing the number of pollinator populations [3], [2]. Climate change seems to affect bee populations mainly by changes in the length of the growing season and flowering time. The negative impact on pollinators may also have air pollution, which makes it difficult to locate plants and thus food sources. It may also negatively affect the behaviour of bees, another suspicion is strong electromagnetic fields, but for clear conclusions about the impact of these forces on the bees are inconclusive [3].</br>
            Hive diseases are the most scrutinized and monitored for honeybees. The most serious pathogens include the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which seriously affects the bee population in Europe since the 60s of the 20th century and which often spread viral and bacterial infections [10], [3]. About diseases among populations of wild bees there are currently insufficient information [3], [2].</p>
            <p>Another important aspect is the impact of pesticides on bee populations. Pesticides can lead to damage to the colony, which can differ in effect and are rarely the sole cause of extinction [2]. In sub-lethal doses of pesticides may weaken colonies in order to boost the effects of other negative pressures. Due to negative impacts on the health of bees and serious suspicions of a direct connection with the so-called. Syndrome collapse of bee colonies [11] were recently in the European Union banned the use of pesticides from the group of neonicotinoids. [12] Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is currently a problem especially in the US, Europe has so far recorded at least one case showing signs of CCD in Switzerland [1]. Besides the direct impact of pesticides on bee colonies should take into account the indirect effects such as those associated with the loss of important pollinators for plants due to herbicide application [3].Decrease in the number of honey bees probably also related to the overall decrease in the number of beekeepers in Europe [8].</p>

          <h3 class="dictionary-item__title">Impacts of the signal</h3>
          <div class="dictionary-item__description">
            We are currently experiencing in Europe contradictory trends, which is the decline in bee colonies, and increase of agricultural production depend on pollination by insects [9]. Bees provide pollination in Europe more than 80% of agricultural crops and the European Commission estimates that these pollinators (e.g. Honey bee, bumble bees and wild bees) contribute each year to European agriculture monetary value equivalent to at least EUR 22 billion [14].<br />
            Therefore, should current trends continue the European agriculture would have suffered huge financial losses. In the extreme cases food supply and food security might be affected.
