          <p>Most of our water - over 80% - comes from groundwater aquifers and rivers, with the rest taken from Iakes and man-made reservoirs. But our water use nearly doubles in the summer, leading to less availability as well as damaging ecological effects. Some of these effects include the drying out of springs, lower water tables and the contamination of these tables with salt water; the Mediterranean seems to be especially prone to this. Reservoirs can be used to collect water and reduce the pressure on groundwater, rivers and Iakes, especially in the summer - but these alone are not enough to prevent the overexploitation and potential depletion of renewable water resources.</p>
          <p>While it is important to seek out alternative sources of water, such as desalination, this can also end up being counter-productive, as this process often uses excessive amounts of energy and the concentration of salt released at the end of the process can negatively affect the environment.</p>
          <p>Using less water, then, is the most prudent way to ensure these resources are available for future use. But to understand how to use less water, we first need to understand where it goes.</p>
