    "text": "\u2022In future all outlook activities done within the Swiss federal administration could be catalogued and formally documented (if not yet the case) so that these may easily be identified and accessed to inform other processes and studies.\r\n\u2022It may be useful to develop an accessible database, or list of known outlook studies and reports so that these can be readily identified and accessed by interested stakeholders, in particular within the federal administration.\r\n\u2022Existing studies are predominantly seen to represent short-term (up to five year) and mediumterm (five to 15 year) outlooks. These could usefully be supplemented with longer-term futures\r\nstudies, looking to 2050 and beyond.\r\n\u2022Consideration could be given to the establishment of a formal inter-departmental committee which meets regularly (for example annually) with the objective to present and exchange information\r\nand knowledge relating to outlook activities, specific studies and their use within the Swiss federal administration.\r\n\u2022One means of ensuring that activities such as those identified above are appropriately resourced and maintained would be for there to be a formal, legal, mandate for one government office to act as coordinator for futures activity within and across the federal administration.\r\n\u2022While foresight is used across a number of federal Offices, there may be benefit in seeking to build the knowledge and capacity among bureaucrats and politicians of how futures studies can inform decision making and be used in policy.\r\n\u2022Stronger links between the federal administration and Swiss academic institutions might help build understanding and knowledge, particularly if one or more dedicated academic chairs were established in relation to foresight for policy.\r\n\u2022With stronger relationships it may also be possible to commission external bodies (both academic and other organisations) to undertake specific long-term outlook studies where such expertise is not available within departments.\r\n\u2022Specifically in the context of FOEN\u2019s objective to make better use of forward looking studies in Swiss environmental policy making, could be to consider if there should be a stronger collaboration between FOEN and the Federal Chancellery regarding environmental outlooks.",

    "document_title": "Barriers to success",
    "text": "Barriers to success identified relating to foresight and futures thinking in Switzerland include:\r\n\u2022 The governance culture may in itself act as a barrier to the wider integration and use of foresight methodologies across the federal administration: the relatively pragmatic approach to decision making in which foresight is often seen as a response to things going wrong, rather than a preemptive approach to policy planning. This in turn leads to a tendency for short and medium-term outlooks rather than real long-term perspectives. One interviewee noted a broader opposition to planning endeavours in public policy (no \u201cPlanwirtschaft\u201d). This indeed may extend to the education system which one interviewee noted is turned towards the present and the past, leaving \u201clittle room for the future\u201d.\r\n\u2022 A lack of formalised coordination or cross-departmental working except in the case of certain specific topics: a study by ETH Z\u00fcrich in 2009 acknowledged that there is in Switzerland a certain foresight culture, but also concluded that \u201cactivities are uncoordinated and dispersed across the administration, universities, and companies, and projects of the administration are usually focused on specific issue areas such as energy, environmental, or landscape and agricultural policy\u201d.\r\n\u2022 One interviewee noted that the Federal Council used to formally approve outlook studies, and declare scenarios \u2018valid\u2019 before they could be used at the federal level. This formal approval procedure no longer exists and this may undermine legitimacy and also lead to concerns over consistency of published outlooks and scenarios. This lack of formal approval and validation may also encourage those involved to focus on pragmatic responses rather than being open to broader and longer-term thinking.\r\n\u2022 High levels of turn-over of staff within federal departments and offices means that in many cases\r\nkey officers / experts are not involved in foresight initiatives from start to finish, this can lead to a loss of technical capacity, methodological consistency and undermine the quality of outcomes.\r\n\u2022 The relatively low level of involvement from senior politicians may weaken foresight activities and outputs, and their use in policy: high-level politicians are seldom seen to participate in futuresrelated workshops (even for studies being prepared on their behalf). One interviewee noted that there is a \u201cdeficit of visibility; as well as lack of resources\r\n\u2022 In the context of climate change outlooks, it was noted that challenges in this regard are linked to large variations in the level of detail of the underlying data and, in some cases, insufficient information upon which projections can be based.",

    "document_title": "Success factors",
    "text": "Success factors identified relating to foresight and futures thinking in Switzerland include:\r\n\u2022 Quality is seen as key. There is perhaps a general perception of foresight among some senior politicians that it is not a robust input to decision making, thus any errors or methodological problems are often picked up and can lead to such studies being viewed cynically or rejected as not important. Studies must be of good quality and based on robust and transparent methodological approaches and sound research.\r\n\u2022 Participation is also an important success factor (and one seen only sporadically in the examples identified). Wide stakeholder involvement in a foresight process can ensure it draws on as wide a knowledge base as possible, and also helps build \u2018ownership\u2019 and recognition. However it is important to ensure effective participation that there is clear explanation of the methodology and process: e.g. models used, assumptions made. Outlook 2025 is seen as an example where wider involvement has been beneficial for the study, but also in building acceptance of its contents.\r\n\u2022 High-level endorsement or approval, for example of the SDS by the Federal Council is seen to have had a legitimising effect on the challenges and measures it identifies. Political leadership is also seen as key, as is support within government. Again this is not seen across the examples reviewed in this study, but was identified as a key factor for success.",

    "document_title": "Interviews",
    "text": "Nine experts and officials in relevant government departments and other institutions directly or indirectly involved in futures thinking studies participated in project workshops, reviewed drafts or contributed ideas and gave their time through interviews.\r\n\r\nInterviews with official indicated that human resources required for futures studies vary throughout the development period of the studies and with the nature of the study in question. Some of the interviewees mentioned that the depth and scope of futures-oriented work is determined by available resources, and that \u201ca stronger political will\u201d to make further resources available to this end would be valuable. This support may come in the form of either larger budget endowments for dedicated government units or, alternatively, grants to external think tanks and academic institutions.\r\n\r\nA number of discussion points emerged in the interviews relating to the consideration of a coordinated approach to cross-departmental working on foresight and outlooks:\r\n\u2022 There are obstacles to an efficient coordination due to the multiplicity of outlook and scenario studies developed. Full coordination would imply developing all of these studies under a common framework (assumptions, time-span, etc.) in a concerted fashion.\r\n\u2022 There is a problem in terms of the coordination of the development of futures studies, as time horizons chosen are often incompatible and/or inconsistent, and therefore so are the outcomes of the futures studies.\r\n\u2022 Time horizons are chosen rather randomly, arbitrarily, which leads to a \u201cchoreography\u201d problem (isolated studies).\r\n\r\nMany of these coordination and timing points reflect the nature of the world and planning / policy and investment cycles. For example energy (and other infrastructure) perspectives and investments are necessarily long term (20 \u2013 50 years), whereas some fiscal and economic policy questions may be determined on a much shorter time-frame (e.g. 5 \u2013 10 years). At the same time there are \u2018random\u2019 or unexpected factors, such as the Fukushima disaster which perspectives need to respond to and which cannot be planned or coordinated.",

    "text": "For this study EEA Blossom approach was followed.\r\nThe approach of this study has also been to seek to identify specific examples of studies and projects with a futures element and to then consider the institutional context of these studies. The focus was on studies produced within the federal administration and in total more than 20 studies were identified as having been produced by federal departments and offices. \r\n\r\nThe three key studies or reports reviewed by this study are: the national Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS); Outlook 2025: Analysis of the situation, context and challenges facing federal policy; and the DETEC departmental strategy.\r\nThese studies have received a particular focus in this study due to their level of policy relevance and relative profile within the federal administration. It is noted however that the SDS in particular has a very short time-frame (2012 \u2013 2015) and is therefore considered short-term rather than long-term in its perspective \u2013 it is not in fact a true outlook study. However, the inclusion of the SDS reflects the longer-term framework it is intended to provide for policy development, as the key challenges it highlights for different policy areas are not time-limited, and its significance at all levels of policy making (federal, cantonal and local).\r\n\r\nOther specific examples include:\r\n\u2022 Economic Scenarios for industrial sectors 2008 \u2013 2030, mandated by the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Statistical Office (FSO).\r\n\u2022 Scenarios for population development of Switzerland 2010 \u2013 2060, developed by the FSO.\r\n\u2022 Environment and Resource Outlook 2050, developed by FOEN \r\n\u2022 Landscape 2020: Analysis and trends, developed by FOEN.\r\n\u2022 Energy Perspectives 2050, developed by SFOE (Federal Office for Energy). \r\n\u2022 Passenger traffic and freight traffic perspectives 2030, developed by ARE.\r\n\u2022 Climate Scenarios for Switzerland, developed by the Advisory Body on Climate Change (OcCC).",

    "document_title": "Governance, Institutions and Futures Programme",
    "text": "Overall governance culture of country:\r\nSwitzerland is a democratic federal state (since 1848), and is organised politically on three levels: the communes; the cantons and the Confederation. Each of the 26 cantons has its own constitution and parliament, and many policy areas are to a degree devolved to the cantonal level (e.g. health care, education and culture).\r\nThe Swiss democratic system is highly, perhaps uniquely, participative, and one in which citizens have extensive decision making powers. In addition to the election of the National Council every four years, eligible voters are generally called on four times a year to vote on federal proposals. Citizens have the right to propose \u2018Popular Initiatives\u2019 (Volksinitiativen), and referenda are also commonly used, in some cases being mandatory, to decide changes in laws and policy. \r\nThe notion of participation and consultation is therefore embodied in the Swiss political system.\r\nAlthough examples of historic and continuous use of outlooks exist in the energy and transport sectors (since the 1970s), there is not a general strong tradition of foresight studies in Switzerland. One interviewee during this study noted that the Swiss approach to policy can be categorised as a very pragmatic one in which decision making and policy development is generally a response to specific questions and issues and is therefore grounded in real examples or practical problems. As a result a longer-term perspective which may provide a less concrete basis for decision making can be perceived as being less valuable or \u2018real\u2019 by senior decision makers and not seen necessarily as important as an input to policy development.\r\nThere is also no formalised central futures programme in Switzerland. However the approach is not entirely ad-hoc, and there are some formal strategic planning processes and outputs that have a forward-looking focus, in particular:\r\n\u2022 The national Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS);\r\n\u2022 The Outlook 2025 study (analysis of the situation, context and challenges facing federal policy) and report which is part of the ongoing legislative planning cycle (though is the first with a foresight approach); and,\r\n\u2022 The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) strategy which is based on a 20 year vision (the 2012 strategy looks to 2030).\r\nIt should be noted that with a time-frame of 2012-2015 the SDS and its Action Plan is only relatively short-term in its outlook, and even Outlook 2025 can be considered medium-term rather than long-term with an outlook of just over 10 years. A long-term study in this context may be considered one with a time-horizon of more than 15 years (i.e. looking forward to 2030, 2050 or beyond). There are also a large number of departmental and sector specific foresight and scenario activities, for example in relation to energy futures, demographics, and the economy.\r\n\r\nMain actors:\r\nThe Federal Council is the ultimate recipient of the two key studies considered, the SDS and Outlook 2025. Political responsibility for the SDS lies with the Federal Council (as instructed by the Parliament). The Federal Office for Spatial Development (ARE) managed the SDS project and is also the coordinating office for the Interdepartmental Sustainable Development Committee (ISDC). Responsibility for the implementation of the SDS and the measures of the Action Plan in particular is borne by the federal agencies concerned.\r\nOutlook 2025 was also commissioned by the Federal Council (in context of Parliament Act, SR 171.10 Art. 146 Procedure for the Legislature plan) and developed by Forward Planning Staff chaired by the Federal Chancellery (Perspektivstab der Bundesverwaltung / Etat-major de prospective de l'administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale). The Forward Planning Staff is made up of one or two representatives from each of the seven federal administration departments7. As noted, the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) has developed a forward-looking departmental strategy (Box 3), and its various federal offices have also produced outlooks in specific policy areas (e.g. environment, transport, energy)\r\nLooking across specific futures studies the following departments have also developed their own activities in relation to foresight in specific policy areas: the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) in relation to long-term perspectives on public finance; the Federal Statistics Office (SFO) in relation to population and demographics; the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) in relation to outlooks for agriculture and the food industry; Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) various environmental outlooks; the Federal Office for Energy (SFOE) in relation to energy outlooks and strategy; and ARE in relation to passenger goods and transport outlooks. \r\nThe Federal Office for National Economic Supply (FONES), which belongs to the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (FDEA) while not a policy-oriented body carries out analysis regarding security of supply to ensure that short-term supply shortages do not result in significant disruption, in the context that Switzerland sources almost 100% of its raw materials, 80% of its energy, 40% of its food, and a large proportion of essential therapeutic products from abroad. Ensuring the national supply of essential goods and services is enshrined in the Federal Constitution.\r\nIn addition MeteoSwiss produce regional climate scenarios (up to 2100) which are intended to form the basis for scenario work in other areas (e.g. infrastructure or spatial planning).\r\nAt the project level \u201cRisks Switzerland\u201d (Risiken Schweiz), a national hazard analysis programme, was initiated by the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP) in the 1990s with a latest report published in 2012. The website of consultants supporting FOCP in their risk analysis work indicates the use of scenarios in analysing risk threats and involving stakeholders. \r\nOutside of government, Swissfuture, the Swiss Society for Futures Studies, which encompasses a variety of members including many from the public sector, produces futures studies on a variety of topics. The Center of Security Studies at ETH Zurich \u2013 Swiss Federal Institute for Technology has provided support to federal departments, most notably the Federal Chancellery in developing Outlook 2025. In addition Avenir Suisse10 a futures oriented think tank which represents a market economy perspective and liberal views has developed foresight studies (particularly economic) for Switzerland.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\nDetailed resourcing or budget endowments for foresight activities and initiatives have not been identified. However, the following were noted through the interviews conducted with relevant experts:\r\n\u2022 The SDS (prepared every four years): two full-time officials lead the development of the strategy. An additional 30 officials (including from other departments) are involved throughout the process.\r\n\u2022 Nine people work in the planning and strategy section at the Federal Chancellery, of which two dedicate part of their time to the preparation of future studies.\r\n\u2022 In Swiss Federal Office for Energy (SFOE), depending on the nature of work two to four people are extensively involved in scenario development and publication of results. Private consultancies or academia are responsible for modelling tools used.\r\n\u2022 Transport perspectives (ARE) estimates that between two and three (in-house) person-years are expended over a period of approximately two years. In years between the preparation of these perspectives, one person-year. Modelling and associated work is largely outsourced to external organisations.\r\n\u2022In the case of Swissfuture, it was estimated that around 400 people are \u201cto some extent\u201d involved in the preparation of futures studies, although the exact number of people working at any given moment cannot be determined due to the lack of formal reporting. Swissfuture has a small budget for their own studies. Sponsorship agreements are concluded for some studies, which can be funded in part or in full. \u201cImportant resource constraints\u201d and limited scope for dissemination of research activities were likewise mentioned with regard to Swissfuture.\r\n\u2022 Swiss statistics estimated that in relation to the development of population scenarios there is approximately 0.8 (80%) of a fulltime post. \r\n\u2022 The Federal Office for National Economic Supply (FONES) is managed by a delegate from the private sector on a part-time unpaid basis. Up to 400 people from the private and public sectors are involved at some point, but only between 10 and 15 people are involved on a regular basis in future studies/vulnerability studies.\r\n\r\nLegal framework:\r\nThere are no specific national formal or legal requirements relating to long-term analysis or foresight in Switzerland, however:\r\n\u2022 Since 1997 the Federal Council developed a SDS every four years. It is part of Swiss legislative planning and considers a long term time horizon. The Federal Parliament, through its Federal Resolution of 18 September 2008, instructed the Federal Councilto update the Sustainable Development Strategy\u2019s Action Plan. \r\n\u2022 Federal Chancellery (Planning and Strategy Section) developer Outlook 2025 in the context of Parliament Act, SR 171.10 Art. 146 Legislature planning. Although this does not represent an explicit legal mandate for long-term / foresight analysis an implicit one can be inferred from existing legislation (Gesetzgebung). In future,there will be a binding legal requirement for the Chancellery to provide this kind of forward-looking assessment.\r\n\r\nFutures work is also often considered to be \u2018implicitly legitimised\u2019 by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nPolitical framework:\r\nThere is no specific high-level mandate for foresight / long-term analysis, however there are some strategic planning process and outputs that have a forward-looking focus, in particular:\r\n\u2022 The national Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) sets out the need for better information about the future (although it does not set out specific time horizons).\r\n\u2022 The SDS is complemented by the Outlook 2025 programme which is a key input to the Swiss legislative planning. \r\n\u2022 In addition the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) strategy is based on a 20 year vision (the 2012 strategy looks to 2030) and defines needs for more outlook information in the fields including economy, population, infrastructure, energy, and spatial planning. In 2010, the President of the Federal Council announced a broad analysis of future trends and challenges, which was reflected in the development of Outlook 2025, which is intended to provide a long-term perspective on policy relevant issues (in the context of legislative planning). It will be repeated for future parliaments.\r\n\r\nPolitical support:\r\nThere is no specific committee / body in Parliament with overall responsibility for foresight activity.\r\n\r\nThere are no specific, formalised advisory councils or offices providing for stakeholder deliberation on long-term issues / policy appraisals. In a sense Outlook 2025 is part of an ongoing advisory tradition to the new Parliament at the start of each term: since 1968 the Federal Council has presented a report every four years to the newly elected parliament setting out the situation and environment in which Switzerland finds itself to help identify important aims and measures for the new legislative period (under Parliament Act, SR 171.10, Art. 146 Legislature planning). Outlook 2025 is proposed to set the frame for future reporting under Parliament Act SR 171.10, Art. 146 Legislature planning, and therefore this may provide a permanent organisational framework for structured deliberation on long-term issues.\r\nThe Interdepartmental Sustainable Development Committee (ISDC) (which includes representation from ARE, FOPH, FOAG, FOEN and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is also an example of a formalised process for considering long-term issues (in the context of sustainable development).\r\nIn the context of energy scenarios, steering groups namely involving representatives from the civil society and other government departments help bring in \u201cspecific expertise and knowledge\u201d.\r\nWith regard to SDS the following exist:\r\n\u2022 \u201cSustainable Development Forum\u201d with target group cantons and cities (two plenary meetings per year)\r\n\u2022 Sustainable Development Dialogue Switzerland with target groups civil society and private sector (one plenary meeting per year).\r\n\r\nInstitutional structure:\r\nAccording Art. 12 of the ordinance of organisation of the DETEC department17 FOEN is the relevant authority for environment. To fulfil its aims FOEN prepares the documentation for a comprehensive and coherent policy regarding natural resources. Therefore FOEN informs about the state of the environment.\r\nUntil now the information about the state of the environment did not include a systematic future outlook regarding natural resources.\r\nAlthough environment-related issues are to some extent considered in futures studies, it was generally agreed that quantifying their implications for sector-specific scenario development purposes tends to be challenging.\r\nFor Outlook 2025 in particular the strategic challenges identified form the basis for an iterative process between the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Council with a view to preparing the strategic plan for the Legislature (Legislaturplan), which provides the overall framework for strategic policies over the coming four years, and to defining the corresponding measures and goals/indicators. The main output is the proposal for a legislative plan (Botschaft \u00fcber die Legislaturplanung).\r\nFor the SDS the evaluation of the previous SDS (2008 \u2013 2011) noted that In terms of use / delivery, the SDS combines existing policy measures under each of the key challenges, and thus does not represent \u2018additional\u2019 activity / policy. However it is noted that the SDS has a \u201clegitimising\u201d effect on many measures: the \u201cgreat importance of the strategy as point of reference, and in legitimizing activities at cantonal and local authority level. At federal level, also, the Strategy promotes awareness and discussion of sustainable development.\u201d\r\nFor widely encompassing studies (such as the SDS), which are addressed to the Government at large and must therefore maintain a certain thematic balance, specific government departments may choose to carry out their own scenario analysis on the basis of the high-level orientations provided.\r\nSwissfuture: Ecological boundaries are contemplated from a competition perspective. The ethical component (social justice, sustainability) is left for political discussions but not included the specific studies carried out by Swiss Future\u2019s members. In the context of Swissfuture, however, work around urban and environmental planning has proven effective according to one interviewee. \r\n\r\nMost future studies reviewed in the context of this project are intended as \u201cinterpretive inputs\u201d to policymaking. They are thus essentially exploratory rather than normative, although the SDS has an implicit normative approach in focussing on future key challenges and exploring progress and needs in relation to these. Outlook 2025 seeks to represent a holistic, exploratory approach that takes major interactions into account with a long-term perspective. \r\nThis can be seen to reflect the wider decision and policy making culture in Switzerland, in particular decision making and policy is made in response to specific questions and issues and grounded in \u2018real\u2019 time examples or practical problems \u2013 this presents as a pragmatic approach.",

    "text": "The Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) 2012-2015:\r\nThe methodology for developing the SDS and the key challenges it contains is not described in detail. However the SDS draws on and relates to the previous versions, and the overarching \u201cguidelines for sustainable development policy in Switzerland\u201d remain unchanged. \r\nThe SDS 2012-2015 development was based on an evaluation of the previous strategy. This evaluation is available online (in German, summary in English):\r\nhttp://www.are.admin.ch/themen/nachhaltig/00262/00528/index.html?lang=en\r\nThe evaluation was conducted by an independent consulting group (INFRAS) and was based primarily on document analysis, as well as interviews with major stakeholders, in particular those responsible for implementing measures at the federal level, as well as individual representatives of NGOs, cantons and local authorities. In addition, representatives of the ISDC office took part in a focus group, while representatives of the ISDC plenum contributed their input at a half-day workshop.\r\nThere is also a brief description of the methodology used in setting the Monitoring Sustainable Development (MONET) indicators in an Appendix to the main SDS document.\r\nA description of the MONET indicator system is also available online\r\n(http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/21/02/01.html).\r\nAn analytical approach was broadly used for the development of the SDS 2012 - 2015, with the study carried out by a group as a desk-based exercise involving research and analysis.\r\nThe evaluation of the SDS 2008 \u2013 2011 did use participative approaches, including interviews with major stakeholders.\r\nThe level of engagement in the evaluation of the SDS 2008 \u2013 2011 was through interviews with key stakeholders (federal, cantonal, municipal and NGOs). There is no evidence of public involvement.\r\nEngagement activities identified relate to implementation rather than development of the SDS.\r\nStakeholder dialogue takes place on an ongoing basis with one formal \u201cplenary\u201d meeting every year (\u201cSustainable Development Dialogue Switzerland\u201d). In addition there is the \u201cSustainable Development Forum\u201d with target group cantons and cities (two plenary meetings per year).\r\nThe SDS 2011 \u2013 2015 mentions cooperation with other stakeholder groups, who are \u201ccalled upon to respect the Sustainable Development Strategy in accordance with their particular scope of action\u201d.\r\nThe SDS also includes a brief Communications section indicating that a proactive approach to sharing and discussing implementation at national, cantonal and municipal levels as well as with civil society and public sector bodies.\r\nAdditional information on the methodology\r\nThe study measures the progress from the last Action Plan using selected indicators from the Monitoring Sustainable Development (MONET) model for monitoring sustainable development in Switzerland. The MONET model, that is maintained by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) came into existence in 2003 and consists of around 75 indicators. MONET undergoes periodic reviews and updates, which means that the choice of indicators used may change.\r\n\r\nThe Outlook 2025 study:\r\nThe content for the Outlook 2025 report was developed in five phases, with the aim of establishing \u201can overview of the most important future issues facing Switzerland\u201d and to \u201cproduce compelling scenarios regarding Switzerland\u2019s development over the next 10 to 15 years\u201d.\r\nThe methodology was based on a combination of trend analysis and scenarios technique.\r\nThe approach drew on \u201cthe collective specialist knowledge of the federal administration and the\r\nviews of experts from business, academic and social fields\u201d.\r\nThe five phases were:\r\nPhase 1: Preparing the groundwork \u2013 identifying important development trends, risks and opportunities.

There is limited specific detail in the report however on actual methods used (e.g. for involving external experts).\r\nThe methodology involved both research and analysis as well\r\nas participation from a wide range of experts. External experts were engaged in Phases 2, 3, and 4. .\r\nPhases 1, 3, 4 and 5 were completed by Forward Planning staff, project teams from within the seven government\r\ndepartments and the Federal Chancellery.\r\nFor example Phase 2 focussed on a validation of development trends and involved external experts from the business, academic and social fields.\r\nIt is proposed in the next Outlook study (2014) to include expert engagement within Phase 1 rather than later phases, with Phases 2 \u2013 5 being developed internally.\r\nWorkshops were the main means of involving external experts in the process.\r\nWider public involvement in the study itself is not evident however the outcomes have been published publically with the intention of engaging politically interested public in ongoing discussion.",

    "text": "The BLOSSOM Hungary country case study sets out the current status of the main institutional and governance arrangements for futures thinking in Hungary with respect to environmental \u2014 and environment-related \u2014 policymaking and overall governance culture. It is based on a review of documentation and other available resources and three interviews with officials and experts in relevant government departments and institutions directly and/or indirectly involved in futures thinking studies. The aim has been to understand better if, and how, futures thinking is undertaken in Hungary, the relationships between different futures thinking initiatives and how these relate to, and influence, environmental policymaking.\r\nThe first seeds of true forward-looking activities in Hungary can be found as early as 1968, the year of the foundation of the Club of Rome. Therefore futures research started first as a response to internationally emerging environmental concerns. Even though there is no permanent body specifically for environmental futures thinking up to this date, various organisations in Hungary have been carrying out internationally well-acclaimed and high standard futures research during the past few decades, occasionally related to the field of environment as well.\r\nThe most prominent centres for futures thinking are the Scientific Committee on Statistics and Futures Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Department of Economic Geography and Futures Studies, and the Hungarian Association of the Club of Rome could also be mentioned. Moreover, there are a number of other organisations, such as other committees of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the National Council for Sustainable Development, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, the Regional Centre for Energy Policy Research or of course the relevant departments in ministries among others, which from time to time get involved in the elaboration of environmentally relevant futures studies or strategic documents. The latter group of organisations carry out many other tasks too, therefore preparing studies or strategic documents pertaining to futures thinking are only complementary and occasional, and often involve external experts.\r\nWhile there is a permanent and stable relationship between the aforementioned three futures research institutes, the link between other organisations is not so straightforward when it comes to forward-looking activities, as these activities are mostly task-oriented, rather than parts of a steadily on-going process. Therefore ad-hoc research partnerships and one time contracts are common. Moreover, even though futures research going on at the academic level could provide a good potential for a more widespread practice of integration of futures thinking into policy documents, this has less frequently been the case. As a heritage of the previous regime, the culture of choosing between alternatives is not yet entirely embedded, having only one option has been a practice for a long time. Many times decision-makers \u2013 as well as the general public \u2013 are not fully aware of the results and capacities of futures research. There is a limited understanding of futures thinking by scientists of other professional background as well. In this respect, reaching a level of \u201ccritical mass\u201d as a futures research community could be an important step forward.\r\nA recent development, however, in the effort to integrate futures thinking into policymaking is the Government Decree on strategic management within the government, which defines the basic compulsory contents of each strategic document type, including forward-looking elements, such as vision or scenarios. It also aims to coordinate national strategies, programmes etc. by creating a strategic system where each component reflects on the other in order of hierarchy. Furthermore, the Decree encourages close cooperation with research institutes.\r\nSome environment-related government strategies and programmes have background futures studies, besides a number of independent futures studies have been also prepared. None of these can be called a futures programme, however. The two most outstanding complex futures studies of the past 15 years are \u201cHungary \u2013 beyond tomorrow\u201d (2001) and \u201cHungary 2025\u201d (2007-2010). Another comprehensive futures study \u2013 in the form of a report \u2013 is \u201cIn Search for the Future\u201d, which was written by the National Council for Sustainable Development in 2009. This report provides the basis for the National Sustainable Development Framework Strategy (2012-2024), accepted by the Parliament in 2013. The draft of the Fourth National Environment Programme (2014-2020) builds its vision on the results of Hungary 2025 and the National Sustainable Development Framework Strategy (2012-2024). The National Climate Change Strategy 2008-2025, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan 2010-2020 and the National Energy Strategy 2030 are also worth mentioning as recent government strategies including forward-looking scenarios. They were accepted in 2008, 2010 and 2012 respectively.\r\nDue to the limited number of recent futures works, no usual tendency or general direction in resource or staff allocation patterns can be observed. The commissioner is mostly different in each example, and the projects show a diverse picture in terms of both the circle and types of involved organisations, thus the number of staff and amount of resources available greatly varies. What seems apparent though is that financial support for forward-looking activities has been decreasing somewhat over the past years.\r\nThere is considerable diversity also in terms of scenarios, methods employed and scale, well reflecting the variety of the organisations that prepared them. The range expands from central research institutions to relatively small consultation firms. We can find examples for both quantitative and qualitative techniques used, however, mostly either one or the other approach was used, integration of the two is less prevalent. The choice of preferred technique depends both on the nature of the topic and on the target group of the study. There are several instances where the scenarios employed in a certain study or strategy were borrowed from an international study, and there is a limited number of cases where forward-looking components of a futures study or strategic document directly influenced each other.\r\nIn the fields of both energy and climate, forward-looking studies were commissioned specifically to support the development of new policy documents and thus analytical work appears to have directly supported policymaking. As regards other forward-looking documents, such a relationship seems less apparent. The implementation of the aforementioned Government Decree could contribute to closing the gap, as well as more widespread recognition of futures studies, closer cooperation between all the various institutions involved in futures thinking, and better assessment and mapping of the needs of decision-makers and available offers coming from the academia.",

    "text": "Overall governance culture of country:\r\nHungary, as well as other Central and Eastern European countries, experienced a period of rapid and intensive social and economic transition from 1989 onwards. One-party rule was replaced by a democratic multiparty system and the centrally planned economy with a market-based economy.\r\nThe Fundamental Law of Hungary (25 April 2011) replaced the old Constitution of 1949 (amended in 1989) to reflect the major political, economic and social changes taking place with the change of regime. Hungary's Government has separate legislative, executive and judicial powers.\r\n\r\nLegal framework:\r\nGovernment Decree No. 38/2012. (12 March 2012) on strategic management in government states that long-term strategic plans should include trends and scenarios, while long-term concepts and mid-term strategic plans should include a vision, on the basis of which targets can be developed. Furthermore, it aims to coordinate national strategies, programmes etc. by creating a strategic system where each component reflects on the other in order of hierarchy. It also calls on close cooperation with research institutes in the development process of strategies.\r\n\r\nPolitical framework:\r\nHungarian National Sustainable Development Framework Strategy for 2012-2024 (accepted by Parliamentary Resolution No. 18/2013. (28 March 2013)) contains a long-term vision, targeting a sustainable future.\r\n\r\nInstitutional structure:\r\nCentral bodies, such as ministries carry out strategic planning, including formulation of visions and outlooks. Specific unit for forward-looking does not exist in government institutions, however, there have been examples of commissioning  futures studies to back the policymaking process\r\nThe National Council for Sustainable Development, with a mandate based on parliamentary resolution, is the conciliatory, consultative and advisory body for issues in all fields related to sustainable development. It consists of representatives of parliamentary parties, science and education, chambers of commerce, trade union and other stakeholders. It was created with the aim of finding solutions to the challenges of the 21st century, and as such, long-term scenario analysis is an important tool for the Council.\r\nThe Scientific Committee on Statistics and Futures Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences is a permanent body to carry out futures researches. The Futures Studies Department (since 2012 Department of Economic Geography and Futures Studies) of the Corvinus University of Budapest and the Hungarian Association of the Club of Rome are closely linked to this work.\r\nNone of these organisations are specialised to any sector, and none of them are permanently affiliated with any government body, however, there are some co-operations between researchers and the government. Within the government, the ministries are responsible for long-term strategic planning.\r\n\r\nMain actors:\r\nAcademic institutions and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 private firms, NGOs and other actors. \r\nThe Hungarian Academy of Sciences (e.g. Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Scientific Committee on Meteorology, the Scientific Committee on Statistics and Futures Research should be especially emphasized as an outstanding centre of futures research and activities in Hungary) and the Corvinus University of Budapest (Department of Economic Geography and Futures Studies) are standing out as leading institutes for futures research. \r\n\r\nAnd other actors:\r\nRegional Centre for Energy Policy Research (REKK)\r\nHungarian Association of the Club of Rome (HUCOR)\r\nMinistry of Rural Development\r\nMinistry of National Development\r\nNational Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD)\r\nHungarian Central Statistical Office\r\n\r\nResources, staffing involved:\r\nAmong the many organisations listed above, there are three \u2013 namely, the Scientific Subcommittee on Futures Research, the Futures Studies Department of CUB and the Hungarian Association of the Club of Rome \u2013 which are particularly specialized for futures research. Recently, the financial support for these organisations has been decreasing somewhat, which explains the mergers, as well as the fact that HUCOR is even in danger of shutting down. This does not only mean that national financing for institutions or projects are decreasing, but opportunities for international or private funds are also less. It is interesting to note that there is a considerable overlap among the staff of each of the three organisations. The head of these organisations emphasised during the interview that professional calling and enthusiasm can compensate the shortage of resources to a large extent. The figures for Hungary 2025 in Table 2 underpin this very idea.\r\nThe other organisations carry out many other tasks, therefore preparing studies or strategic documents pertaining to futures thinking are only complementary and ad-hoc, and often involve external experts. In these cases resources are allocated for each project individually. Due to the limited number of relevant futures works, no usual tendency or general direction in resource or staff allocation patterns can be observed. The commissioner is mostly different in each example, and the projects show a diverse picture in terms of both the circle and types of involved organisations, thus the number of staff and amount of resources available greatly varies.\r\n",

    "text": "Hungary has 45 years of history of futures research that started with an environment-related event, namely the formation of the Club of Rome. Since then the environment, more or less, but has always been a factor to be taken into consideration in works related to futures thinking.\r\nFutures research institutions in Hungary have a good relationship to similar international organisations. The staff of the Futures Studies Department of CUB are members of the WFSF and the WFS. At the Corvinus University there is a PhD course in futures studies. Hungarian futures research organisations are internationally well-acclaimed and high standard, which provides a good potential for a more widespread practice of integration of futures thinking into policy documents \u2013 including of course the field of environment. Presence on international conferences, having resources for (open access) publications and knowledge of the latest methods of futures thinking is a must to be successful and remain relevant in the long-run, though it is a challenge sometimes due to limited amount of resources.\r\nA futures study proved to be very efficiently taken up and utilised in policymaking if it was prepared as a contracted work for a specific strategy, programme etc. This mostly happened in the fields of energy and climate change.\r\nBased on observation, interlinkages between different futures studies have been more likely so far if the same scientist(s)/ organisation(s) was/were involved in the preparation of those studies (e.g. In Search for the Future and NSDFS: same organisation was responsible for both), and/or there is some personal acquaintance. The latter has also proved to be useful in case of commissioning background futures studies for a certain government strategy. It is important to note here that it might not be a desirable outcome, nevertheless, so far these factors seem decisive because futures thinking is not yet a common practice \u2013 even though there are increasing efforts to increase its visibility; so usually a past acquaintance with at least the topic is the prerequisite for considering the need for a comprehensive futures research as backing.\r\nFor better involvement of stakeholders, addressing issues that are understandable and interesting for the general public too, and which they very likely have an opinion about might be an advantageous choice. Pointing out a good example, to ensure a balanced representation and combination of insights of scientists, policymakers and stakeholders alike, Hungary 2025 used an innovative approach and projected the scenarios of scientists onto the scenarios based on stakeholder opinions and not the other way around.\r\nIn case of the NSDFS it was highlighted, that the Strategy was made by an organisation independent from the government, and as such it is credited more stability and probably endurance too in the long-run, because it is impartial and holistic in view, lacking the likely problem of reconciling contradicting priorities of various current policies. Furthermore, chances of the Strategy\u2019s uptake are greatly increased by the fact that it was accepted by a parliamentary resolution, stating that the underlying principles and recommendations should be included into all government strategies etc. in the future.\r\nThe recently accepted government decree on strategic management also provides a framework for all government strategy documents, providing an order of hierarchy and a system of obligations, thus enhancing interlinkages between strategy documents of all levels and sectors.\r\nThe following points have not been realised so far, but are very much likely success factors as well:\r\n\u2022\thaving sufficient financial resources, not only for the assigned research activity, but for publications (e.g. in open access journals) or attending international conferences, and spreading futures thinking on public events;\r\n\u2022\treaching a level of \u201ccritical mass\u201d as a futures research community; full acceptance within the scientific community (as there is a trend of valuing natural sciences more than social sciences);\r\n\u2022\tthe society\u2019s mindset should be accustomed to long-term thinking, realising the idea that everyone is responsible for the future within his/her own area of influence;\r\n\u2022\tthere is a general trust in governing mechanisms.",

    "text": "As a post-socialist country, in Hungary the public as well as the decision-makers themselves are still accustomed to well predictable tendencies and straight upward linear graphs, moreover, the culture of choosing between alternatives is not yet entirely embedded, as for a long time people had been trained to having only one option. There is a limited understanding of futures thinking by scientists of other professional background as well.\r\nPolicymakers often ask for a prediction, or one single scenario. There have also been a few instances when the commissioner prescribed in advance what the desired scenario to be elaborated should be. This attitude does not support the development of well-founded, realistic scenarios.\r\nWhile there is a really good relationship between the three organisations specialised for futures research, links to and between other organisations having been involved in the preparation of any of the documents discussed so far are incidental. Ad-hoc research partnerships and one time contracts are frequent. In addition, it has also been a practice that different teams or organisations are contracted to prepare background study for each strategy document, even within the same field, such as energy. At the same time, having multiple organisations that possess expertise in similar areas of knowledge can be a strength too, given that there is sufficient communication, cooperation and uptake of each other\u2019s results.\r\nFrequent restructuring of government bodies and public institutions does not help either the establishment of long-term working relationships. Another problem is that there is no permanent body specifically for environmental futures thinking. For the time being, utilising available environment related forward-looking information better in government strategies, more vigorous communication and stronger cooperation between strategy makers and futures scientists is necessary to assess the current needs and available offers.\r\nIt was stated among the success factors that the NSDFS was made by an organisation independent from the government, and as such it is credited more stability and probably endurance too in the long-run. However, this very fact might as well be a disadvantage, as the government might not have a strong sense of ownership over the Framework Strategy, or officials might face problems of interpretation.\r\nLack of resources is a barrier too, moreover, during the past few years due to austerity measures there is decreasing financial support for futures research institutions and projects. Opportunities for international or private funds are also less. However, a sense of professional calling and enthusiasm might compensate the lack of resources to an extent. Many webpages related to futures thinking have not been updated with the latest information of the past few years or months, partly also due to lack of resources.",
