Substantial\r\nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed\r\nin the decades ahead to mitigate climate change\r\n(see GMT 9).

Currently\r\nglobal deforestation and forest degradation account for\r\nabout 12% of global CO2 emissions annually (van der\r\nWerf et al., 2009).

Rates of climate change expected\r\nunder medium- to high\u2011emission scenarios (RCP4.5;\r\nRCP6.0; RCP8.5) pose high risks of abrupt and\r\nirreversible regional-scale changes in the composition,\r\nstructure and function of ecosystems, including vital\r\necosystems such as the Amazon forest and Arctic ecosystems. Climate change will also lead to increased\r\ncolonization by alien plant species in Europe and other\r\nworld regions. The risk of forest fires, too, will increase\r\nin almost all world regions due to warming. In some\r\nregions, including in Europe, reduced precipitation is\r\nlikely to contribute to increased tree mortality and forest\r\ndieback. Furthermore, carbon stored in the terrestrial\r\nbiosphere, in, for example, peatland and permafrost,\r\nwill be increasingly susceptible to being lost to the\r\natmosphere.
