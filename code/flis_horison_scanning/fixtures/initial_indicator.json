Instead, it is expected to peak at approximately\r\nnine billion by around 2050 (UN Population Division, 2009) or 2070\r\n(IIASA, 2007). There is a less than 10 % chance that in 2100 there will\r\nbe fewer people than today, or that the total will exceed 11 billion\r\n(Lutz et al., 2008).\r\nConsiderable differences exist, however, in terms of projected regional\r\npopulation growth. A major decline is forecast in eastern Europe (1),\r\nwhere the population is expected to be less than half today's level by\r\n2100. Contrastingly, in many African countries the population is likely\r\nto have doubled by 2100 (IIASA, 2007).\r\n(1) The IIASA grouping for eastern Europe comprises Albania, Belarus,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania,\r\nSerbia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Russia and Ukraine.\r\nFrom 2020\u20132030 onwards, declining populations are also expected in\r\nsome developing countries, especially in Asia. Most of the countries\r\nof North America and western Europe (2) are still growing despite\r\nageing, mostly due to migration (3). However, it is expected that they\r\nwill also register declines if policies are not introduced to compensate\r\nfor the impacts of advanced ageing, for example measures to attract\r\nmigrants.",

Since 1990, migration flows have\r\nbecome increasingly diverse, with growing migration\r\namong developing countries (UN ECOSOC, 2013). Most\r\nmigration occurs within countries, however, in particular\r\nfrom rural to urban areas.\r\nBox 3.1 Intensive livestock raising and risks to human health and environment\r\nRecent studies indicate that more than three-quarters of communicable human diseases are zoonotic in origin\r\n(Woolhouse et al., 2005).\r\nIn coming decades, intensive livestock is expected to expand around the globe to meet the rising demands\r\nof the world's growing urban middle classes, in particular in developing countries, creating many health risks\r\nand environmental impacts. By one estimate, intensive methods already produce about 70% of the world's\r\npoultry and eggs (Liverani et al, 2013). In China, intensive production supplies half of the nation's pork.\r\nThe co-existence of both small-scale, traditional livestock methods and industrial production in developing\r\ncountries, together with the conversion of wild areas to agricultural land, can exacerbate the risks of disease\r\ntransmission from wildlife to livestock and then to humans (Liverani et al., 2013).\r\nIntensive livestock raising creates several health risks, including pandemics. Humans share many infectious\r\ndiseases, such as influenza, with animals (transmitted from animals to humans or from humans to animals).\r\nWhile this link has always existed, the spread of intensive livestock raising threatens to increase the health\r\nrisks. Moreover, intensive methods concentrate large numbers of animals in confined units, providing\r\npotential 'incubators' for existing and new diseases; the most intensive operations use antibiotics against these\r\nthreats and also to boost production, a practice that contributes to worrying drug resistance; and the transport\r\nof increasing numbers of livestock can also spread disease. Wastes from livestock are also a growing risk to\r\nhuman health and the environment. Already, according to WHO, the world's poultry generate as much faecal\r\npollution as humans, and cattle produce four times as much (Dufour et al. (WHO), 2012).\r\nMigration can enable people access to higher incomes,\r\nbetter health care and improved health outcomes. But\r\nmigration can also increase risks of increased transfer\r\nof infectious diseases. A further concern is that many\r\nhealth professionals migrate to take advantage of\r\nopportunities in higher income countries, and in doing\r\nso leave a labour shortage in the health care systems of\r\ntheir home countries (IOM, 2013b).\r\nA particular concern is the forced displacement of\r\npeople due to war and disaster, which reached almost\r\n40 million globally in 2013 (Figure 3.5). Many refugees\r\nface mental and physical stress, poor living conditions\r\nand lack of health care, and are particularly vulnerable to\r\ndisease (IOM, 2013).",

    "assessment": "Principles of good governance are widely accepted across the\r\nworld, both in public and corporate settings, and many have been\r\ninformed by environmental law. Norms and standards can be highly\r\neffective even if they are non-binding. These 'softer' versions of policy\r\ncoordination are increasingly complemented by bilateral policy\r\nlearning and voluntary action. Diffusion of best regulatory practice\r\nbetween nation states is gaining speed as a consequence (Busch and\r\nJoergens, 2005). More often than not it leads to increasing convergence\r\nof policies and standards at the national level, despite worries about\r\nthe absence of progress in international negotiations. International policy processes are increasingly influenced by private\r\nactors, such as transnational corporations or non-governmental\r\norganisations, which represent essential sources of information and\r\nknowledge. While the nation state is likely to remain the overall\r\ndominant source of political power and authority, making and\r\nimplementing transnational norms and rules is increasingly shared with\r\nnon-state actors \u2014 a process terms 'co-regulation' (Falkner, 2008).",
